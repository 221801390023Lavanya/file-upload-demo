# Experiment 15: File Upload and Rate Limiting in Express.js

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This experiment demonstrates how to implement **file uploads** using Multer and **request throttling (rate limiting)** using express-rate-limit in a Node.js/Express API.  
Users can upload files to the server, and excessive requests from the same IP are restricted.
